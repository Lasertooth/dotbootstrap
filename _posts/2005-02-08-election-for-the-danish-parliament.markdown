Today we voted for which representatives we want in our parliament. It was a close race between the center to left wing and the center to right wing parties. The result ended in favour of the center to left wing parties. This means that our current government continues as so far. The exciting part will now be whether or not our prime minister will reshuffle the secretaries.
