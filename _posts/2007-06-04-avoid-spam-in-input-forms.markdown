Here are the top 3 techniques I have used in order to make it more difficult for spammers to fuck with the few web sites and web application I run.

1) Use sessions cookies.

2) For each mail submit form, include a delay of 3 seconds before processing the submission.

3) Include the hidden random fileld. That will ensure that a same mail form will only be processed once.
