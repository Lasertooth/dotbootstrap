It relative hard to tap and spy on mobile phone calls using traditional cracking and hacking techniques on the wire, but since cell and mobile phones contain more computer power than earlier, some software vendors have introduced application to overcome the fairly hard problems related to wiretapping directly on the wire data transmissions. The software programs are instead installed on the actual devices and do a kind of software based spying and wiretapping.

The most popular application packages for phone tapping and spying:
<ul>
	<li><strong><a href="http://www.flexispy.com/">FlexiSPY</a></strong> - works on all Symbian based phones; Nokia, Samsung, LG and Windows Mobile based phones; Cingular, Verizon and Blackberry devices. The program is capable of spying unnoticed on SMS messages and incoming and outgoing calls.</li>

	<li><strong><a href="http://www.davidsteele.com/">Nokia Spy Phone SMS Interceptor</a></strong> - not a pro as FlexiSpy and only capable of spying on SMS-messages</li>
	
</ul>
