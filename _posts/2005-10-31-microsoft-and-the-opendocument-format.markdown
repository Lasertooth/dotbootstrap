Microsoft seems to consider the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument">OpenDocument format</a> as a major threat to their business. According to <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a>, Microsoft is even about to sabotage The Massachusetts Senate decision regarding the adoption of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument">OpenDocument format</a>.

I think that Microsoft should calm down a bit. They have developed and deployed a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary">proprietary document format</a> for years. Because their format is home knitted and proprietary, nobody else can make a piece of software that is 100% compatible and in that way Microsoft created a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in">vendor lock-in</a>.

We are living in a market economy, and by using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in">vendor lock-in</a> they are suspending the market mechanisms. Today the software world seems changed,  it's not possible to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in">vendor lock-ins</a> and thereby suspend the market mechanisms as a solution unnoticed anymore.

All-in-all Microsoft should keep focus on development of great user interfaces, that's what they are best at. They should stop making all that noise. They've had their chance and could have supported the development of a open standard.
