There are many factors which affect Website availability and performance from end user perspective, namely ISP Internet connection, server location, server parameters, programming language, application architecture and implementation. One of the critical parameters is a selected <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system">Operational System (OS)</a>. Most users often need to select between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a> (or an other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix">Unix</a> flavor) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows">Windows</a>, two popular choices for web servers.
Research from the the monitoring service, <a href="http://www.monitor.us/website-monitoring">mon.itor.us</a>, shows that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netbsd">NetBSD</a> as a clear leader in uptime and that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution">BSD</a> severs and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_%28operating_system%29">Solaris</a> also in general demonstrate high uptime. The research further showed that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a> was ahead of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows">Windows</a> every week the test was performed by more than 0.5%. 

For your understanding 0.5% downtime means 50 minutes per week, or 216 minutes or 3 hours 36 minutes per month. The cost of 1 minute of downtime depends on your business but typically if you are running a business application it could be quite high (e.g. see <a href="http://blog.monitor.us/benefits/">this blog entry</a>) &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; up to several thousands and even tens of thousands. One of the reasons for lower uptime for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows">Windows</a> is according to <a href="http://www.monitor.us/website-monitoring">mon.itor.us</a> the reboots needed for Windows after patches, updates and installations.
