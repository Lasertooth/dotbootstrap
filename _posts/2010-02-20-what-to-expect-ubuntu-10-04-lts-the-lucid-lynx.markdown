Ubuntu 10.04 Alpha 2 is available and comes with Linux kernel 2.6.32, KDE 4.4 RC1 and a significant faster boot process. The release is a "alpha" release, which means that it is not fully developed and therefore may contain errors and other obst. The final version of <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu 10.04 LTS </a>it planned to be released on the 29 April 2010.

<strong>Really cool stuff</strong>
<ul>

	<li><a href="http://www.pitivi.org/"><strong>PiTiVi</strong></a> included as default. PiTiVi is considered the most intuitive and featureful movie editor for the Linux desktop.</li>

	<li><strong>The boot process.</strong> The goal is to reach 10 seconds for booting with 10.04 aka Lucid. The adoption of <a href="http://upstart.ubuntu.com/">Upstart</a> is one of the techniques to make the goal come true.</li>

	<li><strong>Hal removal.</strong> The removal of the hal package makes Ubuntu faster to boot and faster to resume from suspend.</li>

	<li><strong>Kernel 2.6.32.</strong> The new kernel means 3D support for newer Radeon graphics chips, better use of power saving features offered by the latest hardware and numerous enhancements to KVM and Btrfs are some of the outstanding items among the many thousands of changes undertaken for the latest kernel version. Various other improvements should also make Linux 2.6.32 more reactive and as a result, feel faster.</li>
