redsn0w is a utility that jailbreaks the 3.0 and 3.0.1 version of the iPhone OS. It does so by downloading the custom firmware from the Internet, and then installing it onto the device. It allows users to install either Cydia or Icy, or both. This allows the user access to tweaks, home-brew applications, and the root directory and file system.

redsn0w is available for Linux,  Mac OS X and Windows. This guide will show howto jailbreak an iPhone using the Linux-based version of redsn0w.
