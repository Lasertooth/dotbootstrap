Today I finished my first web application using <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> and the full-stack open source framework <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>

If you are running <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo</a> linux everything should work out of the box.

Just type this in your console

```
emerge rails
```


And then configure your apache server.
