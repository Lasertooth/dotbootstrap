Today I was trying to scan my home network for different kinds vulnerabilities. It is ages since I last did that kind of stuff. It was back in the days where Nessus was version 2.0.

Well, well, I was surprised to found out that Nessus 3.0 was released and as closed source (the biggest surprise). Because of the closed source approach - it wasn't easy to get it  up and running on my Ubuntu 8.04 installation (read: aptitude install nessus3 was not an option), but finally I got it in - and I got signet up for a "home-user license" crap crap.

I then later today found out that a new and interesting project is underway, <a href="http://www.openvas.org/">OpenVAS</a> - it might become the new Nessus.
