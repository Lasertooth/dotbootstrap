I like the Eclipse Java IDE. It is a well designed and well looking Java IDE and there exist a vast number of plug-ins. Here is the current list of my preferred Eclipse plugins.

<strong>Eclipse Checkstyle plug-in</strong>
The Eclipse Checkstyle integrates the well-known source code analyzer Checkstyle into Eclipse. Checkstyle is a tool to help java developers and helps by checking whether the source code adheres to a set of coding standards. Checkstyle does this by inspecting the Java source code and pointing out items that deviate from a defined set of coding rules. The Checkstyle Eclipse plug-in constantly inspects for problems and within the Eclipse workbench you are notified of problems via the Eclipse Problems View and source code annotations just as you would see with compiler errors or warnings.

<strong>JUnit Factory</strong>
JUnit Factory is an experimental test-generation tool, which is able to auto generate JUnit tests for most programs and with a full suite of characterization tests generated by JUnit Factory you can bring your legacy code under control without any manual and boring work.
