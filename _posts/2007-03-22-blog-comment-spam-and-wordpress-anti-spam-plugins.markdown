Most ( around 90% ) of the spam comments are recognized and trapped by the <a href="http://akismet.com/">Akismet</a> anti-spam plugin, but this still leaves me with a lot of comments to handle manually.

To get rid of this I installed a anti-spam plugin called <a href="http://sw-guide.de/wordpress/plugins/math-comment-spam-protection/">Math Comment Spam Protection Plugin</a>. This plugin ask the user a fairly simple math question while filling out the comment form - basic, but very effective.
