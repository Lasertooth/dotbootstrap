Gmail S/MIME provides  Firefox users with  S/MIME support for Gmail. The S/MIME support is integrated directly into Google's Gmail web interface and allows users to read and send encrypted mails. Signing of messages is supported as of version 0.2.0. Verification of signatures is not supported in the current version, but should be in the works.
