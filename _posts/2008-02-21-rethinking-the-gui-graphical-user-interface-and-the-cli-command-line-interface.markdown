It is obvious that Graphical User Interface-based applications have many advantages over command line interfaces and vice versa. The question is then, could a user interface be designed to incorporate and combine features and advantages from the GUI (Graphical User Interface) and the CLI (Command Line Interface).

Until now a few projects has tried - more or less successful.
<strong>CUI (Composite User Interface)</strong>

CUI (Composite User Interface) - The cuiterm is a pilot application for the CUI (Composite User Interface) methodology made to demonstrate the power of the composite user interfaces.

<strong>Hotwire - Hypershell </strong>
<a href="http://hotwire-shell.org/">Hotwire</a> is an object-oriented hypershell. It is a shell designed for systems programming (files, processes), and thus it is in the same conceptual category of software as the Unix shell+terminal and Windows PowerShell.

<strong>GNOME Command Interface</strong>
<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/">GNOME Command Interface, or GCI</a>, is an experimental command-line framework for the GNOME Desktop. It is more than a drop-in replacement for GNOME Terminal + bash.

<strong>Viewglob</strong>
<a href="http://viewglob.sourceforge.net/">Viewglob</a> is a filesystem visualization add-on for Bash and Zsh. It works by visualizing the directories in a graphical user interface continuously as you navigate in through folders in a Bash or Zsh terminal.
