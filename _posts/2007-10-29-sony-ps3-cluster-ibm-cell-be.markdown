Dr. Frank Mueller, professor at North Carolina State University, has put together 8 Playstation 3's into an awesome super computer cluster. The PS3 cluster has incredible processing capabilities and performance wise the PS3 cluster could be compared to low end super computer clusters - and this is for about only 5.000 US $.
