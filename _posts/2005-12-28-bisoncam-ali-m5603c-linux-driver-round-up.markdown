I have written this as a round up on my search for a Linux driver for the built-in webcam in my Asus A3N series notebook. The built-in webcam in my book is built on a micro chip from Ali and it is named m5603c, more in general the chip is sometimes refered to as m560x. I found that this m560x chip is used in a lot of different devices and even other notebooks like the Asus A6 series.

Right now - it seems that there are a few projects focusing on creating a driver for m560x chip, currently I have noticed these ones.

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://gkall.hobby.nl/">SANE m5603c backend</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/m560x-driver/">Ali M560x Linux Driver Project</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.linux-projects.org/modules/news/">ALi USB2 M5603C Video Camera Controller</a> - Seems stalled</li> 
</ul>



Until now I have assembled this list of devices that are build upon the m560x chip.
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.asus.com/PageError/">Asus Z9100G notebook series</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.sweex.com/en/page-not-found/">Sweex webcam</a></li>
