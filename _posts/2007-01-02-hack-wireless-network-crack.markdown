```

sudo aircrack-ng -b 0a:0b:0c:0d:0e:0f dump-01.cap

```


The MAC after the -b option is the BSSID of the target and dump-01.cap the file containing the captured packets.


<strong>UPDATE Oct 12 2008</strong>
A new project called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pyrit/">Pyrit</a> is currently under it's way. "Pyrit takes a step ahead in attacking WPA-PSK and WPA2-PSK, the protocol that today de-facto protects public WIFI-airspace. The project's goal is to estimate the real-world security provided by these protocols. Pyrit does not provide binary files or wordlists and does not encourage anyone to participate or engage in any harmful activity. This is a research project, not a cracking tool.

Pyrit's implementation allows to create massive databases, pre-computing part of the WPA/WPA2-PSK authentication phase in a space-time-tradeoff. The performance gain for real-world-attacks is in the range of three orders of magnitude which urges for re-consideration of the protocol's security. Exploiting the computational power of GPUs, this is currently by far the most powerful attack against one of the world's most used security-protocols."
