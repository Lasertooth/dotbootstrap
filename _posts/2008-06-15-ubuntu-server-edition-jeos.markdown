<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/business/server">Ubuntu Server Edition JeOS | Ubuntu</a><br /><blockquote>Ubuntu Server Edition JeOS<br />Just enough OS for your virtual appliance<br /><br />Ubuntu Server Edition JeOS (pronounced "Juice") is an efficient variant of our server operating system, configured specifically for virtual appliances. Currently available as a CD-Rom ISO for download, JeOS is a specialised installation of Ubuntu Server Edition with a tuned kernel that only contains the base elements needed to run within a virtualized environment.<br /><br />Users deploying virtual appliances built on top of JeOS will benefit from:<br /><br />    * better perfomances on the same hardware compared to a full non-optimised OS<br />    * smaller footprint of the virtual appliance on their valuable disk space<br />    * fewer updates and therefore less maintenance than a full server installation</blockquote>
