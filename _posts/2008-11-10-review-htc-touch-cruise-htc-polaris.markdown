Back in September I got a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_Touch_Cruise">HTC Touch Cruise</a>.

<strong>User Experience</strong>
The phone is very slow to boot and become ready to use. It has boot times, which could be compared to normal Windows-based computers, which means around 20-50 seconds.

The user interface and the user interaction feels sluggish, very sluggish in fact. I upgraded to the newest firmware version available, but it didn't reduce the slowness.

Compared to the Apple iPhone user interface and user interaction the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone">iPhone</a> is ages ahead.



The single positive thing about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_Touch_Cruise">HTC Touch Cruise</a> is the availability of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TomTom">TomTom navigation software</a>, which transforms the H<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_Touch_Cruise">TC Touch Cruise</a> into a really full-blown car navigation system.

Last week I turned down on my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_Touch_Cruise">HTC Touch Cruise</a> and started using my old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_E50">Nokia E50</a> again as it is a lot more faster to use.
