I often wondered why Fedora marketing doesn't care about small, but very remarkable features - to make some remarkable PR. Some remarkable features might affect that more people from the Mac or Windows segment make some attention to the Fedora project. Those people like things that just works out of the box - even more important they like small nifty features. To make Fedora more known it's needed to pinpoint features that are special, remarkable and rememberable.

Until now I've found the following small bluetooth applications that I think are able to make people think - oh! what a nice thing - and make this oh! big enough to make them remember it.

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://freecode.com/projects/btcid">btcid</a> - a small application that shows whether there is a incoming phone call in a bluetooth enabled phone nearby. Most importend - now it's possible to mute xmms or what ever needed.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.geektown.de/">blue-cmd</a> make it possible to lock or shutdown your computer when you leave with your bluetooth mobile phone.</li>
  <li><a href="http://usefulinc.com/">Gnome Phone Manager</a> enables you to recieve and send SMS messages from your PC desktop trough your mobile phone</li>
</ul>

Here I focused on mobile integration applications, maybe you have some other ideas of special, remarkable and rememberable ones.
