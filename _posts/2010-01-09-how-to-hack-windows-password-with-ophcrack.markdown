First, let me remind you that Windows security is very bad in relation to password storage, so it is very easy to recover, crack / hack your own windows administrator password. (remember that you should only crack our own accounts and not other users' accounts without having the necessary permissions).

The tool we are going to use is called <a href="http://ophcrack.sourceforge.net/">Ophcrack</a>, which is a free Windows password cracker based on rainbow tables. It is a very efficient implementation of rainbow tables done by the inventors of the method. It comes with a Graphical User Interface and runs on multiple platforms.


<strong>How to perform the actual password crack / recovery / hack</strong>


<ul>
	<li>Download the Ophcrack Live CD from <a href="http://ophcrack.sourceforge.net/download.php">here</a>.</li>
	<li>Burn and boot the Ophcrack Live CD</li>
	<li>When Ophcrack finishes booting (it take a while, so be patient), you'll see a list of all of the accounts available in your Windows installation. Click on Launch to initialize the cracking process.</li>
	<li>As Ophcrack starts working, you'll see several strange letter combinations appearing in the LMpasswd1 and LMpasswd2 fields.</li>
</ul>

I'm really impressed by the ease and speed that Ophcrack delivers. I managed to crack / hack / recover my Windows admin password in just 30 minutes, even though I used a password generator to generate a "secure" 8 letter alphanumeric password ;-)
