Microsoft's successor to Windows Vista may 9th January 2009 test of all interested. The first public beta version is ready, said the message from Steve Ballmer on Consumer Electronic Show in Las Vegas in January when he kept his keynote speech.

Download is via Microsoft's Windows 7 page (<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/meet">link</a>), but Microsoft is expected to put a cap on the number of downloads. If you are a part of the Microsoft Developer Network, you can now download the beta OS.

In contrast to the beta version, which in October were shared out among a handful of other journalists, had the next public beta version include virtually all the features that the final version of Windows 7 given for the final launch.

The steering system is put for sale in October 2009. Preliminary tests have shown that Windows 7 makes lower demands on hardware than its predecessor Windows Vista which gave many an older hardware with many problems. Thus, there will be more computers that can run Windows 7 with an acceptable speed than Windows Vista, which is new. All other launches of new operating systems from Microsoft have put higher demands on power than its predecessor - it's great to see that the trend is broken.
