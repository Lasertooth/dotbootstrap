I have spend the last two days on figuring out howto get one of our customers' javascript and css to work in the Mac Internet Explorer 5.x series. It has been two very frustrating days - I simply kept feeling that it was waste of time and money. The problem with  Mac IE 5 series is that it doesn't support dynamic generating of selects and options the standard way. However I found a quick hack at <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/">http://www.quirksmode.org/</a>, but it didn't do the job.


I think Internet Explorer 5.x development team spend way too much time in the hustler club instead of doing some good implementation of the W3C standards.
