Today Stig Hjarvard from <a href="http://www.ku.dk/english/">University of Copenhagen</a> gave a lecture on the new norms connected with new medias. He gave some very useful perspectives on the use of media - some of them, which Klaus Kaasgaard only discussed briefly and superficially on the <a href="/web-20-seminar-with-klaus-kaasgaard/">seminar I attended last week on Web 2.0</a>.
