<a href="http://www.debianhelp.co.uk/adminutilities.htm">Debian Administration Utilities - Every Debian Admin needs</a><br /><blockquote>diffmon - Tool for reporting changes in system configuration.<br /><br />This tool is run by a nightly cron job, and takes a `diff' of specified system configuration files and emails them to a specified email address. Options to diff can be specified. This is useful in friendly environments where there are multiple sysadmins working on configuration files/setups and everyone's changes are reported. CVS is a better answer, but most of us don't want to have the hassle of putting system files in a repository.<br /></blockquote>
