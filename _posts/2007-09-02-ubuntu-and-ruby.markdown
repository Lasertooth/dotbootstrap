There are several ways to install <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_programming_language">Ruby</a>. The first option is simply to download the source code and compile and install it by hand. However, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu">Ubuntu</a> has it great package management system, which allows easy installation of almost all freely available open source software. 

Use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu">Ubuntu</a> apt-get like this to install ruby, the interactive ruby shell, and the related ruby documentation:

sudo apt-get install ruby irb rdoc

The irb and the rdoc is available from the universe repository.
