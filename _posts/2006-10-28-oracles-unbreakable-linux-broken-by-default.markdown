This week <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation">Oracle</a> stated that their own Linux version (read: fork) of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat">Red Hat's</a> Enterprise Linux was more refined and better than its <a href="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</a> competitor/flavour, but according to <a href="http://blog.ultramookie.com/entry.php?id=uncompatible-linux">this review</a>, Oracle&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Unbreakable Linux seems broken by default.
