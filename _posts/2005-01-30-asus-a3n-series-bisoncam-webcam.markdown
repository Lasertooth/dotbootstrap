I just mailed Asus in Sweden, because I couldn't get the built-in BisonCam Webcam in my Asus A3N series working under Linux Fedora Core 3.

Hello,

I just bought an Asus A3N-series with a built-in webcam, but it does not run natively under Linux 2.6.10, Fedora Core 3.

What kind of chipset is the BisonCam built on?

Do you have any clues on how to get it to work in Linux?
