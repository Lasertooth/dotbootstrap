According to <a href="http://www.datamation.com/">itmanagement.earthweb.com</a> <a href="http://www.datamation.com/">the numbers, clearly, point to a major industry trend</a>.

<blockquote>
Take a look: Dice, the tech jobs site, reports that it had 9,631 Linux job listings in August. While this is a big number, what&acirc;&euro;&trade;s truly eye-catching is the percentage growth since January: Linux job listing are up a robust 30 percent &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; three times the increase of overall tech job listings. (Since January, Dice job listings have grown by 10.2 percent, to a total of 96,548 tech jobs.)

To be sure, Linux jobs continue to trail the mighty Windows, which had 16,895 listings. Linux also falls behind Unix &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; still healthy after all these years &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; which boasted 14,954 listings. (The AIX flavor of Unix had 2,302 jobs, and Solaris posted 4,055.)
