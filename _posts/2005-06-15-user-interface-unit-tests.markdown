Today I started testing with <a href="http://ietest.sourceforge.net/">IETest</a> and <a href="http://ieunit.sourceforge.net/">IeUnit</a>. Both are Unit test libraries for testing web sites through Microsoft Internet Explore. With this approach I'm able to perform my test cases in just a few secondes. Before I used to spend at least 15 minuttes of testing by hand almost every day.


Now, I only need to find a similar library based on <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla</a> to be able to do testing through <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla</a> and <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a>
