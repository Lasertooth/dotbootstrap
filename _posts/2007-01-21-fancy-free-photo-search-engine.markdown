It features a huge index with over quarter million free to use photos and images licensed under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain">Public Domain</a>, <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html">GNU FDL</a>. An excellent resource for web designers. The most fancy thing about the search engine is, that is has got a color search function, which means that it is possible to search for photos containing a specific color - very very fancy.
