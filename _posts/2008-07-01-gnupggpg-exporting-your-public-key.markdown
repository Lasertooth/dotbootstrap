<a href="https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/">Exporting your Public Key</a><br /><blockquote>Before you can use public key cryptography, other people must have a copy of your public key. To send your key to correspondents or to a keyserver, you must export the key.<br /><br />To export your key, so you can display it on a webpage or paste it in email, type the following command:<br /><br />gpg --armor --export <you @example.com> <my-email@gmail.com> > mykey.asc</you></blockquote>
