Today both <a href="http://www.mandriva.com/en/">Mandriva</a> and <a href="http://www.opensuse.org/en/">SUSE</a> released new versions of their Linux Desktop systems. Mandriva released Mandriva Linux 2006 and SUSE released <a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/">SUSE Linux 10.0</a>

So right now I'm currently downloading the SUSE Linux 10.0 torrent with all the ISO images
