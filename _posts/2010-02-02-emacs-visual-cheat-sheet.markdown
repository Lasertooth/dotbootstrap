Emacs is a very challenging editor to learn to use visual learners that are raised with Microsoft Word and other visual (read more or less over-engineered editors) so to help alleviate the keyboard navigation blues, a guy called Steven Chan has created a Emacs Visual Cheat Sheet, which is as the names mentions visual and provides an easy way to learn emacs and the most common keyboard shortcuts.

The cheat sheet includes navigation commands, the most common commands for Open/Save/Close, working with buffers, searching, and Copy/Cut/Paste edit functionality.
