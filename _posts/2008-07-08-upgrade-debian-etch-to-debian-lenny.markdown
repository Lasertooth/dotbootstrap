Upgrading distributions are not always easy, but on Debian it is quite easy.

1. Edit and change keywords like <b>stable</b> or <b>etch</b> to <b>lenny</b>
<blockquote>sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
</blockquote>

2. Update and upgrade:
<blockquote>sudo apt-get update &&amp; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
</blockquote>
