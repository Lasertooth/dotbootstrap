<a href="http://windowsitpro.com/">Paul Thurrott on Microsoft IE 7</a>

<blockquote>
Boycott IE. It's a cancer on the Web that must be stopped. IE isn't secure and isn't standards-compliant, which makes it unworkable both for end users and Web content creators. Because of their user bases, however, Web developers are hamstrung into developing for IE at the expense of established standards that work well in all other browsers. You can turn the tide by demanding more from Microsoft and by using a better alternative Web browser. I recommend and use <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla Firefox</a>, but Apple Safari (Macintosh only) and <a href="http://www.opera.com/computer/windows">Opera 8</a> are both worth considering as well.
