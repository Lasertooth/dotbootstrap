<blockquote>Your server is wasting your CPU

TAGS: AMD

While using an AMD Barcelona (quad-core Opteron) server to create a portable benchmarking kit for InfoWorld's Test Center, I discovered something unexpected: I could incur variances in some benchmark tests ranging from 10 to 60 percent through combined manipulation of the server's BIOS settings, BIOS version, compiler flags, and OS release.



I attempted to document the impact that each individual change had on performance, but flipping one switch often changed the effect of all the others. This frustrating yet fascinating effort ran aground when I had fiddled with settings and flags so much that my testbed stabilized; I could no longer budge the results no matter what I did. Normally stability is a good thing, but in this case, I was more interested in investigating the variance than in eliminating it. If I tried to bring this case to an actual engineer, he or she would likely tell me it had all been a mirage.</blockquote>
