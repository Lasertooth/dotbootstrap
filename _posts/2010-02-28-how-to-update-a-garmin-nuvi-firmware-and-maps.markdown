Updating your unit software just got easier. Use WebUpdater to automatically keep your operating software current. The Garmin WebUpdater can be downloaded from <a href="http://www8.garmin.com/support/download.jsp">Garmin</a>.

If you need to update your software / firmware from Linux, you can actually extract the downloaded exe and upload the unit software / firmware update file (e.g. called GUPDATE.GCD) manually to the device.
