The <a href="http://www.ffii.org/">Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure</a> is currently running a campaign to avoid the broken <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ooxml">OOXML</a> (Microsoft Office) to become the ISO standard for document exchange. The campaign includes a protest petition - and so far almost 25000 have already signed the petition. The petition can be signed here

They have some very good arguments on why the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ooxml">OOXML</a> shouldn't become the standard:
<ol>
<li>There is <strong>already a standard ISO26300 named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument">Open Document Format (ODF)</a></strong>: a dual standard adds costs, uncertainty and confusion to industry, government and citizens;</li>
<li>There is <strong>no provable implementation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ooxml">OOXML</a> specification</strong>: Microsoft Office 2007 produces a special version of OOXML, not a file format which complies with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ooxml">OOXML</a> specification;</li>
<li>There is <strong>information missing from the specification</strong> document, for example how to do a <strong>autoSpaceLikeWord95</strong> or <strong>useWord97LineBreakRules</strong>;</li>

<li>More than <strong>10% of the examples mentioned in the proposed standard do not validate</strong> as XML;</li>
<li>There is <strong>no guarantee that anybody can write software</strong> that fully or partially implements the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ooxml">OOXML</a> specification <strong>without being liable to patent lawsuits or patent license fees by Microsoft</strong>;</li>
<li>This <strong>format conflicts with existing ISO standards</strong>, such as ISO 8601 (Representation of dates and times), ISO 639 (Codes for the Representation of Names and Languages) or ISO/IEC 10118-3 (cryptographic hash);</li>
<li>There is <strong>a bug in the spreadsheet file format which forbids any date before the year 1900</strong>: such bugs affect the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ooxml">OOXML</a> specification as well as software applications like Microsoft Excel 2000, XP, 2003 and 2007.</li>

<li>This <strong>standard proposal was not created by bringing together the experience and expertise of all interested parties</strong> (such as the producers, sellers, buyers, users and regulators), but by Microsoft alone.</li>
</ol>
