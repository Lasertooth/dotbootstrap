Today <a href="http://www.novell.com/home/">Novell</a> and <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Welcome_to_openSUSE.org">OpenSUSE</a> launched a new usability initative called <a href="http://www.betterdesktop.org/wiki/index.php?title=Main">BetterDesktop</a>. I visited the <a href="http://www.betterdesktop.org/wiki/index.php?title=Main">new project site</a> and found a lot of <a href="http://www.betterdesktop.org/wiki/index.php?title=Main">videos  with test persons that did different kinds of tasks</a>. It's nice to see that they are infact sharing that kind of data public on the internet.
