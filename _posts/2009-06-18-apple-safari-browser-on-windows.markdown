What is Safari? It is a browser. It is a platform. It is an open invitation to innovation. Safari expands the boundaries of the Internet and gives you also a world-class user experience.

It is now possible to download and install Apple's Safari Web browser on your Windows platform. Note that the client is in beta and therefore probably, but it works flawless on most machines.

Apple Safari can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">here</a>.
