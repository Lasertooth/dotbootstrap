Microsoft Windows is collapsing under its own weight and radical changes are needed to change that according to Gartner.

<blockquote>
Microsoft&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Windows juggernaut is collapsing as it tries to support 20 years of applications and becomes more complicated by the minute. Meanwhile, Windows has outgrown hardware and customers are pondering skipping Vista to wait for Windows 7. If Windows is going to remain relevant it will need radical changes.

That sobering outlook comes courtesy of Gartner analysts Michael Silver and Neil MacDonald. Half of a full room of IT managers and executives raised their hands when asked whether Microsoft needed to radically change its approach to Windows. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Windows is too monolithic,&acirc;&euro;¬ù says Silver.

Well, Well - Finally somebody shed light on this issue.

Could he same thing be said about the recently ISO-approved standard OOXML, since it is very bloated too - especially compared to OpenDocument (odf).
