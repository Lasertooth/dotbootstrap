Today I found a solution to my everyday problem with firefox. Everyday when  I connect my notebook to the wireless network at the university I have to switch my proxy settings. Until now I have done this manually in the connection settings menu. These days are over now with the SwitchProxy extension

This sounds like something from a commercial, I know, but it really solved my stupid problem. Now I just need something like a global proxy settings switch for the entire desktop environment.
