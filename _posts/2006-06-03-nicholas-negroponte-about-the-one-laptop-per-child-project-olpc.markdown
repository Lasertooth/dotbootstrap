<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Negroponte">Nicholas Negroponte</a> about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLPC">One Laptop per Child project (OLPC)</a>

<blockquote>"AMD is our partner, which means Intel is pissing on me. Bill Gates is not pleased either, but if I am annoying Microsoft and Intel then I figure I am doing something right," he said.

Microsoft allegedly offered to build the operating system for the machine but was rejected by the OLPC project. Negroponte added that the project required an extremely scaled-down OS to enable the eventual machines to run at a decent speed, while using very little power. "About 25 percent of the cost of a laptop is there just to support XP, which is like a person that has gotten so fat that they use most of their muscle to move their fat," he said.</blockquote>
