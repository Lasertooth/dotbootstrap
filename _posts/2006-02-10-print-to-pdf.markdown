I often need a method for printing directly to pdf files. Until now I have tried several different solutions, but none of them, not even adobes own acrobat solution, produces postscript compliant pdf files. Now I have found a open source solution called <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdfcreator/">PDFCreator</a>, and it's simply the only piece of pdf software that is able to produce postscript complaint pdf files.
