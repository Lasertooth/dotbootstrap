The German authorities are encouraging Internet users to immediately abandon the use of Internet Explorer for security reasons.

The Web browser from Microsoft is the most widespread in the world, but the German authorities consider that the Internet Explorer is vulnerable to attacks from hackers. The warning comes from the <a href="https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Home/home_node.html">Bundesamt f&uuml;r Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik</a>, which is a department in charge of overall IT security in Germany.

<strong>Vulnerability Triggers The Concern</strong>
Authorities advises citizens to use alternative browsers. A web browser is a computer application that is used to retrieve and display among other web pages from servers around the world. 

The concern arised when Google last month, was attacked by Chinese criminals or authorities, where many e-mail accounts were hacked. Hackers also tried to break into approx. 30 companies.

Microsoft rejects the warning and finds that the risk of attacks against ordinary users is low. A spokesman for Microsoft in Germany, Thomas Baumgaertner, therefore states, that the German authorities over-react: "The attack was not directed against ordinary citizens or consumers. It is not a threat to the general user, and therefore we are not up hills on this warning.

<strong>New updates on the way it is version 6, 7 and 8 of Internet Explorer</strong>
Microsoft said the company already has started to solve problems and that new updates are coming. Windows systems; XP, Vista and Windows 7 are apparently is affected by the vulnerability.

<a href="https://www.google.com/intl/de/chrome/browser/">Google Chrome</a> and <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Mozilla Firefox</a> are both good an better designed alternatives to Internet Explorer.
