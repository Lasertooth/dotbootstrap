Google has started to offer <a href="www.google.com/drive/start/apps.html">hosted Gmail solutions</a>. This means that everybody with a domain and a significant large organization or business could start offer their members a <a href="http://gmail.google.com/">Gmail</a> based webmail service - for free - since google earns money by showning ads to the <a href="http://gmail.google.com/">Gmail</a> users. Seen from a <a href="http://www.google.lu/">Google</a> perspective, I think this initiative could result in a major cashcow.
