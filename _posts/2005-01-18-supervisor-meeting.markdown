My girlfriend and I had agreed to go for a small run this morning but we were so tired that postponing it seemed to be the perfect solution. Thus my day began a bit off guard.

I got up a few minutes after she had gone to work. I had a meeting with my study group and my supervisor at Aalborg University at 0930. We had to discuss some details concerning an upcoming exam this Friday at 1230.

Finally I have handed in my week assigment I was given last Monday, yesterday to be more precise. What a relief that was to get that off my back. Now I only need to pass my exam this Friday and then I'm done. With my exams at least.

It's going to be tough my next semester however I like to get things out of my way when possible so that all the difficult things doesn't catch up on me when I'm head over heals with e.g. work so I have no worries.

It's been one of the good days today..
