He released a program called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management">QTFairUse</a>, which is free and open source and first released in November 2003. It works by basically dumping the raw output of a QuickTime AAC stream to a file, which thereby could bypass the digital rights management (DRM) algorithm used to encrypt music content of media files and save the un-DRMed media files as normal media files - like mp3 and wma.
