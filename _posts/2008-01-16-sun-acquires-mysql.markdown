<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL">MySQL</a> was recently named a top IPO for 2008 by <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2008/01/10/markets/ipo/copeland_ipowatch.fortune/index.htm">CNNMoney.com</a>, but Sun came ahead. It will be interesting to see in what direction Sun will drive MySQL.

<strong>About MySQL</strong>

<blockquote>
MySQL is the leading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">open-source</a> database company on the planet. Its software might not have the bells and whistles of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Database">Oracle 11</a>, but it also comes at a much cheaper price. According to the venture capitalist lunch chatter, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL">MySQL</a> is expected to file very soon.
