<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Terminal">gnome-terminal</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konsole">konsole</a>, wterm, rxvt and Eterm - Linux has a number of well developed and mature terminal applications, but according to a blogger nobody has performed a decent comparison of their text display performance.

With this motivation the guy did some performance tests and was able to conclude that both "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Terminal">gnome-terminal</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konsole">konsole</a> are exceptionally fast" by taking only only 0.25 to 0.59 seconds to display a 647976 bytes large file, but hey are both very memory hungry, while the more memory efficient ones; wterm, rxvt and Eterm are less speed efficient. And xterm is just slow :)
