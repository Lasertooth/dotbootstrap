If you ever have problems syncing Apps through iTunes, here is a way to get around that. Requires knowledge of SSH and a jailbroken iDevice.

# Install Installous through http://cydia.hackulo.us repo
# SSH and place cracked .IPA app in /private/var/mobile/Documents/Installous/Downloads/ directory
# Open Installous from iDevice and go to Downloads section
# Click on the IPA you just copied over, and hit Install

In this tutorial I used iPhone 4 on iOS 4.0.1
