Today I dropped by <a href="http://tdc.se/">TDC.se</a> - I found that TDC's customers in our lovely neighbour country are able to get a broadband connection with 28 Mbit download and 1 Mbit upload for 299 SKK around 240 DKK - and that's very cheap. Compared to that, TDC in Denmark charges 799 DKK for a 8 Mbit connection. Furthermore TDC doesn't even deliver connections with more than 8 Mbit download in Denmark.

What's happening?
