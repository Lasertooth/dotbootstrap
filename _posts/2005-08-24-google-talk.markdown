Today I started using <a href="http://www.google.com/talk/start.html">Google Talk</a>.

My first thought was that the client was more light and usefull than any other Instant Messenger client I have seen so far.

Moreover Google Talk is based on <a href="http://www.jabber.org/">Jabber</a>, a secure and open XML protocol for instant messaging.
