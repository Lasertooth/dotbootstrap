<a href="http://ianmurdock.com/solaris/how-package-management-changed-everything/">What&acirc;&euro;&trade;s the single biggest advancement Linux has brought to the industry?</a>

According to the GNU/Debian Linux founder Ian Murdock the answer is: <strong>Package management</strong>.

I believe that Ian is right. Some will argue that Microsoft has introduced the (Windows Installer) MSI, but it is far from what the Debian and the Gentoo package management system delivers. - Maybe the Windows Installer and the powerful Linux based packaging system cannot be compared.
