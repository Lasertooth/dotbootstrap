I'm a day to day <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice</a> user and I like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenOffice.org">OpenOffice</a>, but over time I have stumbled over features, which was lacking - compared to Microsoft Office 2007. With the release of <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice 3.0</a> in September a number of the features that I miss the most in my daily use of OpenOffice seems to get implemented and integrated. Here is my list features that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenOffice.org">OpenOffice</a> lacks in comparison to Microsoft Office 2007.

<ol>
	<li>Presenter Screen in Impress - Powerpoint has got a nifty and very user-friendly presenter view - as far as I can see, a <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/roller-ui/errors/404.jsp">presenter screen for Impress is in the works</a></li>
	<li>Support for Office Open XML - <a href="http://www.oooninja.com/2008/03/openofficeorg-30-new-features.html">seems to get integrated too</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.oooninja.com/2008/03/openofficeorg-30-new-features.html">More polished UI - Calc seems to get a new theme for the 3.0 release</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://katana.oooninja.com/w/openoffice.org/performance_improvements">Performance - both in terms of speed and space</a> - My experience: OpenOffice is slow, but it seems to get better and better</li>
	<li>Native PDF-import - <a href="http://www.oooninja.com/2008/03/openofficeorg-30-new-features.html">seems to be in the works</a></li>
</ol>
