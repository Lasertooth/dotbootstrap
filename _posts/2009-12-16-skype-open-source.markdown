According to the <a href="http://blogs.skype.com/2009/11/02/skype-open-source-2/">Skype forum</a> there's an open source version of Linux client being developed. It will be a part of larger offering, but don't communicate much information about it as of now. The version also seems to be limited to an open source UI, which it means that it will help Skype to get adopted in the land of Linux distributions, as well as on other platforms, but the protocol related stuff will remain proprietary.
