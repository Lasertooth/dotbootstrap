<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/06/12/lg-claims-flatron-w2252te-is-worlds-most-energy-efficient-moni/">LG claims Flatron W2252TE is "world's most energy-efficient monitor" - Engadget</a><br /><blockquote><img style="max-width: 800px; float: right; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px;" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-jMChYYB-plI/UVl_oOXH4iI/AAAAAAAAFw4/Jsp8v_QN6mY/lg-flatron-w2252te.jpg" width="200px"/><br /><br />LG has just announced what it claims to be the "world's most energy-efficient monitor," and it looks like it's been able to lay claim to that (potentially dubious) title without making too many compromises on specs. That includes a 22-inch screen size with a 1680 x 1050 resolution, a lofty 10,000:1 contrast ratio, a 2 ms response time, a 170 degree viewing angle, and a 250cd/m2 brightness rating, all while supposedly maintaining a 45% (or roughly 40W) reduction power consumption compared to other models. No word on a price, unfortunately, but the Flatron W2252TE will apparently be available in the UK this August.</blockquote>
