This release features among other things seamless integration of Windows-based applications in Linux. This means the ability to run windows-only programs and application like Microsoft Office, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Acrobat, Microsoft Project, Microsoft Dynamics etc. on Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Red hat, Mandriva , openSUSE, etc.) without any complicated and complex setups.

The VirtualBox virtual machine stands out among the current virtual machine software available because most of its parts has been released under GPL. Moreover the project seems very active and the project team produces frequent releases.
