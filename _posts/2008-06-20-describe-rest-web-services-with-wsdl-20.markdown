The term REST Web services generally refers to a resource-based Web services architecture that uses HTTP and XML. Each of these architectural Web service styles has its place, but until recently, the WSDL standard didn't equally support both styles. The WSDL 1.1 HTTP binding was inadequate to describe communications with HTTP and XML, so there was no way to formally describe REST Web services with WSDL. The publication of WSDL 2.0, which was designed with REST Web services in mind, as a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation means there is now a language to describe REST Web services. </blockquote>
