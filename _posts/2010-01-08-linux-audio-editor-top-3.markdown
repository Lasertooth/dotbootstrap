<strong>Audacity</strong> (No 1 Linux Audio Editor)
<a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a> is a digital audio editor and recording application. Audacity is free, open source and cross-platform, available for Windows, Mac OS X, BSD also. Audacity was created by Dominic Mazzoni while a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University. Mazzoni now works at Google, but is still the main developer and maintainer of Audacity, with help from many others around the world.

As of 20 October 2009, it was the 6th most popular download from SourceForge.net, with 63 million downloads. Audacity won the SourceForge.net 2007 Community Choice Award for Best Project for Multimedia.


<strong>Sweep</strong> (No 2 Linux Audio Editor)
<a href="http://www.metadecks.org/software/sweep/index.html">Sweep</a> is a digital audio editor and live playback tool for Linux, BSD and compatible systems. It is able to handle many sound formats, including MP3, WAV and Vorbis. The most notable feature of Sweep is its stylus-like cursor tool called Scrubby. Sweep is included in most modern Linux distributions. Released under the GNU General Public License, Sweep is free software.



<strong>ReZound</strong> (No 3 Linux Audio Editor)

<a href="http://rezound.sourceforge.net/">ReZound</a> is an digital audio editor primarily for, but not limited to, the Linux operating system. Licensed under the GPL. ReZound is free software. Presently, ReZound's focus is on editing audio files for permanent change as opposed to arranging and/or filtering existing audio files to produce a composite work. It can optionally load a variety of audio file formats being dependent upon several audio file libraries. ReZound implements a standard set of editing tools and digital filters (some these tools with useful twists on the usual theme). Additionally, it supports loading LADSPA plugins. The last ReZound version, 0.12.3beta, was released on January 13, 2007. The project seems to be stalled as of 2008-01-26.
