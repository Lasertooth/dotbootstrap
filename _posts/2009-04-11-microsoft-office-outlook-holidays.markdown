One of the more popular features for Outlook's calendar is the capability to add your country or region's holidays into your calendar. This way, you'll never miss the next holiday.

Adding holiday items to your calendar is pretty easy and holiday calendars can be downloaded from the net.

Here I have collected to most used holiday calendars.

How to install the holiday calendars :
 * Click the link Download holidays for the selected region or country.
 * Select Open
 * Chop the box next to the selected region or country
 * Select OK
