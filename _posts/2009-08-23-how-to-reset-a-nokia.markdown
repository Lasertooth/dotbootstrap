If your Nokia phone isn't working properly or not responding like it is supposed to do, or in cases where you just want to delete everything; SMS messages, contacts etc. Here bellow there described two ways to reset Nokia mobile phones:

<strong>Soft Reset</strong>

Soft Reset will clear pending errors and bring your mobile to an initial state by restoring Factory setting. To operate this function on your mobile, the shortcut is: *#7380#

This function apparently works on almost all nokia mobile phones.


<strong>Hard Reset</strong>

It may happen that despite you have restored your mobile to factory setting, the error still exist. In this case, it is recommended that you opt for Hard reset

Enter the code: *#7370# and press Yes to confirm initialization.

Important Notice: It is recommended that you save all important information on your phone (e.g: memo, contacts etc)
Note

To make a Hard Reset on a Nokia phone that is not willing to turn on, just press simultaneously these 3 buttons:

on/off + * + 3


Before making a Hard reset better backup all your important information: contacts , calendar, memo etc.
