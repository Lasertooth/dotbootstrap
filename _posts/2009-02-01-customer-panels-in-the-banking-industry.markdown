Today to my big surprise I found out that my bank, <a href="http://www.jyskebank.dk/wps/portal/jfo/forside">Jyskebank</a>, recently launched a <a href="http://kundepanel.jyskebank.dk/">web-based customer panel</a>.

As a user experience expert I think such an open initiative a great thing to do as a company, since it may let the customers and users to speak up - in a more unformalized manner.
