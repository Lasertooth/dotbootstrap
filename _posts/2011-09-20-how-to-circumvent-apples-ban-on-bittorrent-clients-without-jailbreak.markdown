With BitTorrent becoming increasingly popular as a source for legal as well as illegal content Apple iPad and iPhone users have had to face the critical decision of whether or not to jailbreak their device &ndash; until now.

However with a few easy steps BitTorrent users can circumvent Apple&rsquo;s ban on BitTorrent clients in the app store with a few steps.

<ol>

	<li>Download and Install Dropbox or like</li>
	<li>Set Up a Torrific Account</li>
	<li>Find Torrent URL &ndash; Has to be from a public tracker. Terrific doesn&rsquo;t yet support trackers that require user authentication beyond what can be passed in a URL. Example: <a href="http://torrents.thepiratebay.org/6384486/BackTrack_5_[Gnome]_[32-Bit]_[ISO]_[geno7744].6384486.TPB.torrent" target="_blank">http://torrents.thepiratebay.org/6384486/BackTrack_5_[Gnome]_[32-Bit]_[ISO]_[geno7744].6384486.TPB.torrent</a></li>

	<li>Once your download is finished you&rsquo;ll receive an e-mail notification with a direct link to your file.
</li>
	<li>Open direct link to begin downloading or view a movie or video directly using VLC or like on the iPhone or iPad.</li></ol>
