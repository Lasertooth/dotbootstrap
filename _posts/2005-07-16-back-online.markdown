Yesterday S&oslash;ren and I spent all day upgrading servers. Our snox server got a brand new Debian Sarge installation. We also converted yet another hacked Windows 2003 Server to Debian Sarge. Unfortunately all data on one hard disk crashed while we were backing up. Bad bad.

This morning we replaced the broken one with a new one and now it's back online.
