Yesterday <a href="http://personprofil.aau.dk/102862">Dr. Borchmann's</a> old Ph.D. buddy from <a href="http://bss.au.dk/">Aarhus School of Business</a>, <a href="http://www.jyskebank.dk/wps/portal/jfo/kontakt/afdelingsinfo?departmentid=13710">Poul Bonde Jensen</a> from <a href="http://www.jyskebank.dk/wps/portal/jfo/forside">Jyske Bank</a> gave a lecture on Value-Based Management. The lecture was just a worth-while experience because Bonde Jensen was able to concretize the theoritical issues down to real world ones - in this case the different aspects of management within <a href="http://www.jyskebank.dk/wps/portal/jfo/forside">Jyske Bank</a>.
