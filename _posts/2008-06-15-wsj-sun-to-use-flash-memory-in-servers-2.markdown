<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121252511195342507.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">Sun to Use Flash Memory in Servers - WSJ.com</a><blockquote>Sun Microsystems Inc. is betting that a technology called flash memory will be a big deal in big computers, not just little machines.<br /><br />The Santa Clara, Calif., computer maker said it plans in the second half of the year to begin storing data in server systems using flash memory chips, replacing or augmenting the disk drives ordinarily used in such systems. Flash memory is already widely used in cellphones, portable music players&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and increasingly laptop computers&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;because of benefits that include low power consumption and high speed.</blockquote>
