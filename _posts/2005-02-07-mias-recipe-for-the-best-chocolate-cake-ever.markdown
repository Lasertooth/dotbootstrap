<strong>What you need is:</strong>

<ul>
  <li>250 g  margarine</li>
  <li>400 g  sugar</li>
  <li>5      eggs</li>
  <li>40  g  cocoa</li>
  <li>400 g  flour</li>
  <li>3   teaspoonful baking powder</li>
  <li>1   teaspoonful vanilla powder</li>
  <li>1   decilitre milk</li>
  <li>1   decilitre boiling water</li>
  <li>100 g dark chocolate</li>
</ul>


<strong>Toppings</strong>
<ul>
  <li>walnuts</li>
  <li>frosting, either white or cocoa</li>
</ul>


<strong>How to go about it...</strong>

You melt the margarine and softly stir it with the sugar. Then you add one egg at a time and stir in the cocoa. Finally you add the flour, baking powder, vanilla powder, the boiling water and the milk. 

Let the paste be in the oven for an hour at 175 Celcius Degrees. 

When the cake is done, decorate it with frosting firstly, then with walnuts and perhaps some grated chocolate to finish the job. 

Good luck!
