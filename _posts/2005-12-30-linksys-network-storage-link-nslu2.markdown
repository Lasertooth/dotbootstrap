Yesterday I bought a NAS-server device - a <a href="http://www.linksys.com/en-eu/home">Linksys Network Storage Link NSLU2</a>. The NSLU2 was AFAIK the best device in terms of value for money. Inside the NSLU2 Linksys placed a small customized Linux distribution - this doesn't more or less mean anything in it self, but since the Linux  kernel is released under the terms of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU Public License</a>, and same is the official Linksys NSLU2 Linux distribution, that it self means that it's posible for anyone to modify the software within he NSLU2. A few NSLU2 user groups on the internet has taken that posibility, and created new and enhanched software releases for the NSLU2 - more formally these software releases are called firmware. On <a href="http://www.nslu2-linux.org/">http://www.nslu2-linux.org/</a> I have found a lot different firmware releases and hardware hacks, and there is there is descriptions on the site how to: <a href="http://www.nslu2-linux.org/wiki/HowTo/AddPrinter">add a printer</a>, <a href="http://www.nslu2-linux.org/wiki/HowTo/AddPrinter">add a USB webcam</a>, <a href="http://www.nslu2-linux.org/wiki/Peripherals/EthernetAdapter">add a extra ethernet adapter</a>, and so on. All in all getting a NSLU2 is connected with a lot posibilities seen from a hacker perspective ;) - the question is only what to do and not to do. By now I think my NSLU2 should  just serve as a straight NAS-server and outbound FTP-server.
