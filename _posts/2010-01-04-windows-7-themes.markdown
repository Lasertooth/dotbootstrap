This post reviews the five most popular free for download themes for Windows 7 available on the internet.

Themes for Windows often requires different types of heavy and resource demanding 3rd party software, e.g. like ThemeXP and others. In this post I have collected the most popular themes that do not require additional 3rd party software, but just works out of the box. Don&rsquo;t bother on trying them with Vista or XP because they just wont work.
