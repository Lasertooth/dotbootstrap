Yesterday my girlfriend and I watched the newest comedie in Danish film making called <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0418455/">Adam's apples</a>. 

The "layout" was there with great actors like Mads Mikkelsen, Nikolaj Lie Kaas and Paprika Steen however not even they could fulfill our expectations to this film prior to Anders Thomas Jensen's film making.

So therefore I cannot recommend you to spend the 1&frac12; hour it takes to watch the movie - it is so bad!
