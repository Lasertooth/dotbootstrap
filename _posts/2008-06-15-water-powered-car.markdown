<a href="http://science.slashdot.org/story/08/06/14/1737231/japanese-company-says-laws-of-physics-dont-apply-to-cars">Slashdot | Japanese Company Says Laws of Physics Don't Apply &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; to Cars</a><a href="http://www.reuters.com/video/2008/06/13/water-fuel-car-unveiled-in-japan?videoId=84561&amp;;"><img style="max-width: 800px; float: right; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px;" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-KUfAa0qDfnM/UVl_nOZmh5I/AAAAAAAAFww/YodYO6nXxRo/water-powered-genepax.jpg" /></a><blockquote>Fantastic Lad, among many others, points out another in a long series of claimed "powered by water" cars, this one by a Japanese company called "Genepax," which interestingly enough does not have so much as a Wikipedia entry. What's scary is the uncritical, even serious-sounding, presentation by Reuters of such extraordinary claims quite unbacked by extraordinary evidence. "Almost sounds too good to be true" isn't the half of it; if cars could be made which would run as "long as you have a bottle of water inside" to pour into the fuel tank ("even tea," repeats this report), not only would you know about the car, but you'd notice the long lines of people buying generators, laptops, and power tools that run on the same technology. The snippet Reuters is carrying says "Jun. 13 &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; Japanese company Genepax presents its eco-friendly car that runs on nothing but water. The car has an energy generator that extracts hydrogen from water that is poured into the car's tank. The generator then releases electrons that produce electric power to run the car. Genepax, the company that invented the technology, aims to collaborate with Japanese manufacturers to mass produce it." Fantastic Lad, deadpan, goes on: "Check out the Reuter's story and accompanying video. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't there some sort of conservation of energy thing happening in the whole 'separating hydrogen from water' game? I wonder what the real story is on this. Investment fraud? Magic?"</blockquote>
