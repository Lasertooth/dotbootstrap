.htaccess files (or "distributed configuration files") provide a way to make configuration changes on a per-directory basis. A file, containing one or more configuration directives, is placed in a particular document directory, and the directives apply to that directory, and all subdirectories thereof.

Ever wanted a specific directory in your site to be available only to people who you want it to be available to? Ever got frustrated with the seeming holes in client-side options for this that allowed virtually anyone with enough skill to mess around in your source to get in? htaccess is the answer!

<a href="http://www.webmaster-toolkit.com/htaccess-generator.shtml">This .htaccess generator</a> will generate the files you need (.htaccess and .htpasswd) to password protect a directory of your website. Just input the username and password you require, plus the exact path of the directory you want to protect.
