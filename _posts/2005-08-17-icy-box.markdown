Today I got a new piece of hardware. I got an external USB hard disk box and a Maxtor 250 Gb disk with 16 Mb of Cache. <img class='right' src='http://lh5.ggpht.com/-54f8Psz9A0o/UVl8ctiRfnI/AAAAAAAAFdo/CkzfrVdR-_Q/thumb-billede010.jpg' alt='Icy Box' />

Unfortunately the external box is equipped with three cathode pipes with blue light, so already before I got it switched on I disconnected two of the cathode pipes on the sides of the box. I left the connector to the front cathode on because it's used to signal activity on the disk.

Lucky me they are pretty easy to disconnect
