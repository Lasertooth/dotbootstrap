Credit card numbers are just number that conform to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm">Luhn formula (Modulus 10 check)</a>.

Generated credit card numbers are useful for testing e-commerce sites and payment gateway software solutions. They should given their Luhn check compliance be able to get past local validation rules - often just a Luhn check - nevertheless they should be declined at the card processing back-end.

<strong>Update - 13. December 2009</strong>

I have just deleted ~400 comments from people asking for and people trying to sell credit card information. Let me try to outline the usage of a test credit card generator - the generated cards is only supposed to used for testing purposes in relation to implementation of credit card processing system.

Comments related to selling or buying credit card information; card numbers, pan numbers, cvv etc. will be deleted automatic.
