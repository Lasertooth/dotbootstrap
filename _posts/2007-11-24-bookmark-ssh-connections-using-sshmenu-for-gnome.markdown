As a regular <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a> user I use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH">SSH</a> over and over again during a workday. Normally it is almost the same hosts I connect to every day or just a few different, all in all the amount of hosts I connect to regularly is fairly small.

To avoid tedious and repetitive username and host type-ins, I found a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME">GNOME</a> applet called <a href="http://sshmenu.sourceforge.net/">SSHMenu</a>, which keeps all regular <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH">SSH connections</a> available within a single mouse click.

This screenshot depicts the idea.
