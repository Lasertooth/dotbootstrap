<strong>Before you launch your site, you should have done the following:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Optimized your title tags on each page to contain 1 - 3 keywords</li>
	<li>Created unique Meta Tags for each page</li>
	<li>Used appropriate markup where necessary</li>
	<li>Used keywords liberally yet appropriately throughout each page</li>
	<li>Designed the navigational structure of the site to channel PR to main pages (especially the homepage)</li>
	<li>Used Search Engine Friendly URLs (if necessary)</li>
	<li>Created a complete website with plenty of quality content</li>
	<li>Used keywords in your domain and url (http://www.keyword1.com/keyword2/keyword3.html)</li>
</ul>



<strong>Immediately after launching your site you should do the following:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Submit your site, by hand, to all major search engines</li>
	<li>Submit your site to all free directories - dmoz, yahoo</li>
	<li>Begin a link building campaign (attempting to get keywords in the reciprocal link anchor text)</li>
</ul>


<strong>Finally, as part of an ongoing strategy:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Continually update your website with quality content</li>
	<li>Continually seek free and reciprocal links preferably from sites in your genre</li>
</ul>
