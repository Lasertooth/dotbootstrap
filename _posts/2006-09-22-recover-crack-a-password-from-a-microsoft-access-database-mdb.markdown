Today, I had to do a password recovery from an old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_access">Microsoft Access Database</a>. First I thought that this was a very time consuming task, but as I searched on <a href="http://www.google.lu/">Google</a> I found a great number of utilities to do that kind of password recovery / crack, but none of the shiny tools I found in the first round were free, so I searched on and found a free utility called <a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/accesspv.html">Access PassView</a> - and it's able to do the job. I tried to password protect a sample access database and it worked - it recovered the password within less than a second :)

The author of <a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/accesspv.html">Access PassView</a> mentions that it has a few limitations; In Access 2000/XP files, it cannot recover passwords that contains more than 18 characters and it's only able to recover the main database password. It cannot recover the user-level passwords.

You can download <a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/accesspv.html">Access PassView</a> from <a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/accesspv.html">this page</a> or <a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/accesspv.zip">directly from this location</a>.
