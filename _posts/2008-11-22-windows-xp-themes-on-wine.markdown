Be default the look of Wine is ugly - it always reminds me of the Windows 98 and Windows 2000 days.

But actually Wine supports theming - just like Windows XP - so you are able to apply the traditional Windows XP themes to Wine, like for instance the <a href="/free-xp-themes/">The Luna Theme</a>, <a href="/free-xp-themes/">The Energy Blue Theme</a>, <a href="/black-windows-xp-theme/">The Royale Themes</a> and <a href="/free-xp-themes/">The Zune Theme</a>.


You can apply a theme to Wine by doing the following steps
<ol>
	<li>Open a terminal and then run winecfg</li>
	<li>Select the &acirc;&euro;&tilde;Desktop Integration&acirc;&euro;&trade; tab</li>
	<li>Click on &acirc;&euro;&tilde;Install Theme&acirc;&euro;&trade;</li>
	<li>Download a theme - perhaps the The Royale Theme from <a href="/black-windows-xp-theme/">here</a></li>
	<li>Extract the file into a given folder</li>
<li>After that browse to the folder that contains the theme&acirc;&euro;&trade;s .msstyle file and select it and press open</li>
</ol>
