I'd been looking for a top nut secure password storage, which featured an easy and user-friendly interface and incorporated support for many users without the users should be equipped with the same shared password - which in general is bad and hard to maintain in almost any organization.

I almost gave up searching and even considered writing something myself based on <a href="http://gnupg.org/">gnupg</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard">wikipedia article on gnupg</a>), but then I came across <a href="http://www.harry-b.de/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=harry:cpm">Console Password Manager (CPM).</a> In my search I also came across <a href="http://keepass.info/">KeePass Password Safe</a>, <a href="http://www.keepassx.org/">KeePassX</a>, and even <a href="http://passwordsafe.sourceforge.net/">Password Safe</a>. The password managers I have been looking on are all characterized by using a single shared password for encryption and decryption of the password storage, except from <a href="http://www.harry-b.de/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=harry:cpm">Console Password Manager (CPM)</a>, which uses private public keys instead of shared symmetric keys.

<a href="http://www.harry-b.de/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=harry:cpm">Console Password Manger (CPM)</a> is written by Harry Brueckner and incorporates a number of great features; it's console-based - some will argue that console application aren't userfriendly - but think again - it really is more friendly to access through a slow remote connection, security is well-considered in it's design, and finally it relies on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy">GPG keys</a> for encryption, which is wide-used and already incorporated in many other systems - mail clients, mailing in general and for signing software, just to mentioning a number of places, moreover it seems to be well-maintained.
